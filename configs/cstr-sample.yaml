objective:
  description: >
    Build a thermodynamically-extended nonlinear dynamic model for a non-isothermal
    continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR). The model will be used to design control
    and optimization strategies that regulate reactor temperature and outlet
    concentration while monitoring and reducing entropy generation. The model takes
    feed flowrate, feed temperature, applied heat duty, and coolant (jacket) temperature
    as inputs, and predicts reactor_temperature, outlet_concentration, and
    entropy_generation_rate based on coupled mass and energy balances and a
    thermodynamic expression for entropy generation.
  input_variables:
    - feed_flowrate
    - feed_temperature
    - heat_duty
    - coolant_temperature
  output_variables:
    - reactor_temperature
    - outlet_concentration
    - entropy_generation_rate
