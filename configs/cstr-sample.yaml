objective:
  description: >
    Build a physical model for a multivariable continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR).
    The model will be used to design a control strategy for controlling reactor temperature
    and outlet concentration. The CSTR has two manipulated variables: coolant flowrate
    and feed flowrate, allowing reactor temperature and outlet concentration to be controlled.
    The model should capture the nonlinear dynamics of the CSTR, including reaction kinetics,
    heat transfer, and mass balance equations.
  input_variables:
    - feed_flowrate
    - coolant_flowrate
    - coolant_inlet_temperature
    - feed_concentration
    - feed_temperature
  output_variables:
    - reactor_temperature
    - outlet_concentration
    - coolant_exit_temperature
  success_criteria: >
    Provide at least two candidate model structures (e.g., nonlinear versus
    linearized decoupled forms) that clearly map manipulated variables to
    controlled variables.
