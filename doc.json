      "text": "The continuing depletion of fossil fuel reserves and the increasing environmental concerns has encouraged engineers and scientists to look for an alternative, clean, and renewable fuel that can reduce the negative environmental impact. Biodiesel has been considered as one of the best candidate of one of these renewable fuels. One of the pathways to biodiesel production is the transesterification reaction of triglycerides from vegetable oils and short-chain alcohols. A batch reactor is employed for the production of biodiesel. The flexibility of the batch process allows operating the reactor with different feed stocks and product specifications. This condition becomes challenging for the reactor modeling and control since uncertainty in the feed composition turns into time-dependent uncertainty and requires a batch-process based stochastic optimal control. In the first part of this work, the optimal control in this reactor involves optimization of the concentration of fatty acid methyl esters, well known as biodiesel, under the control of reactor temperature and the strategy applied to solve this problem is based on the maximum principle. The strategy increased the concentration by 8.46%. As far as the minimum time required to obtain the same base concentration, it reduced the reaction time by 69.5%.",

      "text": "Among the preoccupations that concern the world are the reduction of petroleum reserves due to the increased use of diesel fuel, and the environmental issues that caused by the climate change. This situation brings significant attention to new alternatives that secure the future energy supplies. For instance, researchers have focused their investigations to explore plant-based fuels, plant oils, and fats as promising bio-fuel sources. As a result, biodiesel derived from vegetable oils, can be an option to replace diesel. Biodiesel, consisting of methyl esters of fatty acids, is commonly obtained by transesterification of vegetable oils that compromise triglycerides with methanol in the presence of a catalyst. This clean renewable fuel is superior to diesel oil in terms of sulfur and aromatic content. Also, it is environmentally safe, non-toxic, and biodegradable. Moreover, it can be used in any compression ignition engine without the need of any modifications. Different raw materials can be used in order to produce biodiesel, such as rapeseed, palm and sunflower; however, one of the most common procedures is from soybean, which is used as a case study in this paper.\n\nThe transesterification reaction can be carried out in a batch reactor. Batch reactors are used for small-scale operations such as testing new processes, the manufacturing of expensive products, and for processes that are difficult to convert to continuous operations. This type of reactor is appropriate for chemical, pharmaceutical, and biotechnological processes wherein the product quality and quantity play an important role in the process.\n\nIn the biodiesel reaction, the yield is affected by different parameters; however, researchers have considered four main factors: molar ratio between alcohol and triglycerides, reaction time, catalyst, and reaction temperature. For instance, an excess of alcohol can guarantee the complete conversion of fats or oils to esters in a short time. Usually, the molar ratio employed is 6:1 in the presence of alkali catalyst. On the other hand, the conversion rate of fatty acids esters increases with time and it has been found that the yield reaches a maximum at the reaction time of less than 90 min. An excess of reaction time will decrease the yield due to the backward reactions and it will cause more fatty acids to form soap. The catalyst also plays an important role since its concentration increases the conversion of triglyceride, which increases the yield of biodiesel. The most commonly used catalyst is sodium hydroxide. Finally, a higher reaction temperature can decrease the viscosities of oil resulting in an increased reaction rate and a shortened reaction time. Moreover, it is possible that the yield of biodiesel decreases when the reaction temperature rises beyond the optimal level since it accelerates the saponification reaction of triglycerides.",

The reaction consists of three stepwise and reversible reactions where triglycerides (TG) are converted to diglycerides (DG), diglycerides to monoglycerides (MG), and monoglycerides to glycerol (GL). In each step an ester (R_iCOOCH_3) is produced resulting in three molecules of Ester from one molecule of triglycerides. All reactions are carried out at atmospheric pressure.

In contrast, research works have highlighted the best operating conditions that can affect the yield of the transesterification reaction based on feedstock used. In this two part paper, we address the problem of optimal control for biodiesel production by using the deterministic system of dynamic equation in part 1 to calculate the optimal temperature profile. The objective function is to maximize the concentration of methyl ester (biodiesel) by finding the best temperature profile in a given reaction time (100 min). The maximum principle formulation is used. The objective function is expressed as a linear function in terms of final values of state variables (C_i) and the constant values (A_i):",

This algorithm starts with the initial estimate temperature T(t) and solves the state and adjoint equations by employing the RKF method with a step size equal to 0.01.

      "text": "Figs. 3 and 4 present the profiles of Hamiltonian derivatives and Temperature per iteration. From these figures, it can be seen that as the profiles of the gradients (dH/dT) decrease; the temperature profiles increase which improve the objective function. Fig. 5 shows the initial guess of temperature T(t) = 323 K and the optimal temperature profile obtained after the stopping criteria. Fig. 6 presents concentration profiles for the six components. The purpose of this figure is to show that as the reaction proceeds, the concentration of the desired product, methyl ester, increases; however, after 65 min there is no significant change in these values. Finally, Fig. 7 illustrates the concentration profile of methyl ester comparing the concentration profiles at constant temperature from the two base cases with the values calculated at optimal temperature profile. It can be seen that at 100 min of reaction time, the concentration of methyl ester at optimal control temperature reaches its maximum value, 0.7944 mol/L; while at constant temperature, the maximum concentration is 0.7324 mol/L. On the other hand, for the base case 2 the maximum concentration is 0.7829 mol/L. Comparing these values, there is an increment of 8.46% with base case 1 and 1.47% with base case 2. For base case 2, the reduction on time represents 46% of the original reaction time if the concentration is fixed to 0.7829 mol/L.",

      "text": "In this article, the deterministic optimal temperature profile for biodiesel production in a batch reactor is determined. Under this framework, the feed composition remained constant. The maximum principle was used to solve the optimal control problem. The advantage of this method is that it avoids the solution of second order differential and partial differential equations that are required in other techniques. Numerical results showed that twelve iterations were enough to reach the maximum concentration of methyl ester. The deterministic profile was compared with two base cases: (1) constant temperature of 315 K and (2) optimal temperature of 323 K. As a result, it was presented that at 100 min of reaction time the concentration value of methyl ester increased 8.46% for base case 1 and 1.47% for base case 2 when the optimal temperature profile was employed. On the other hand, it was shown that the methyl ester profile obtained from the optimal temperature profile can reach the maximum concentration in less time; in other words, the profile with optimal control reached 0.7324 mol/L at 30.5 min for base case 1 and 0.7829 mol/L at 54 min for base case 2, which implied a reduction of 69.5% and 46% in batch time, respectively. For this reason, optimal control provides improvement to the effectiveness of batch processing.",
