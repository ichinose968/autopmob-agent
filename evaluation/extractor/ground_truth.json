Starting from standard mass and energy balances with Arrhenius kinetics, the authors derive an explicit expression for the entropy generation rate in terms of reactor temperature, inlet temperature, and reaction conversion. Using total entropy differentials and the entropy balance (including heat transfer, flow, and reaction contributions), they obtain a compact entropy production formula involving the thermodynamic driving force ΔG_R/T. Direct minimization of this entropy generation expression yields an optimal operating condition where the inlet temperature equals the reactor temperature, which coincides with high conversion. The paper also compares this direct entropy minimization with an indirect method based on the product J·X between flows and driving forces.",
