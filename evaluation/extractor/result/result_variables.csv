   - Ground truth `x(t)` matched with prediction `x(t)`.
   - Ground truth `u(t)` matched with prediction `u(t)`.
   - Ground truth `f(x(t),u(t))` matched with prediction `f(x,u)`.
   - Ground truth `\dot{X}` matched with prediction `\dot{\mathbf{X}}`.
   - Ground truth `\Theta(X,U)` matched with prediction `\Theta(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{U})`.
   - Ground truth `E` matched with prediction `E`; slight difference in units as (kJ/kmol) is considered synonymous.
   - Ground truth `Q(t)` matched with prediction `Q(t)` despite description differences. 
   
2. Definition and description clarifications:
   - Ground truth `X` matched with prediction `\mathbf{X}` based on near synonymity in definition.
   - Ground truth `U` matched with prediction `\mathbf{U}` as they both define a snapshot matrix.
   - Ground truth `\Sigma` matched with prediction `\Xi` based on synonymous definition for sparse regression coefficient matrix.
   - Variables `\gamma_j` vs `\beta_j` were not perfectly matched; predictions provided a different regressor structure.

3. Failures: 
   - No prediction for ground truth `\lambda` as prediction `\lambda` concerned thresholding parameter.
   - No matching prediction for ground truth `V_r` and `K`; though `R` and `K_0` had definitions.
   - Outlier matches happened for `z_j` and `L`, showing variable mismatch.

Thus, the scores reflect incomplete overlap in correct predictions. Symbol, definition, and description matches allowed a comprehensive evaluation beyond apparent mismatches."

6. T^{e}: Inlet temperature
7. T^{c} matched with T_c: Coolant (jacket) temperature (symbol slightly differs in LaTeX representation)
8. \rho: Liquid density
9. c_p: Specific heat capacity of the liquid
10. \dot Q: Heat transfer rate to/from the reactor
11. UA matched with U A (similarly, symbol connector absence is accepted)
12. k_0: Pre-exponential factor of the reaction rate
13. E: Activation energy of the reaction 
14. R: Universal gas constant

Single match found based on description:
26. F matched with Feed volumetric flowrate by description/meaning
27. \Delta H: Heat of reaction 
28. S(T, n_A, n_B): Entropy as a function of temperature and moles of species (based on function description indirectly implies presence in equation)

False Positives (FP):
1. \Delta H_{R}: Entropy change entropy balance not explicitly listed in Ground Truth
2. E/R: Activation temperature parameter not found
3. J X: Entropy production per unit volume not found 
4. \Delta G^{0}: Symbol for Gibbs change at reference temperature not recognized

False Negatives (FN):
1. t: Time
2. C_B: Concentration of species B in the reactor
3. C_A^e: Inlet concentration of A
4. T_0: Reference temperature
5. \Delta T: Temperature difference relative to the reference
6. \Delta H^{0}: Standard heat of reaction at reference
7. \Delta S_R: Entropy change of the reacting system
8. s^{e}: Specific entropy in the inlet stream

In conclusion, the Prediction list performed reasonably well with precision close to 0.8, indicating a good match between items from the Prediction and Ground Truth lists, supplementing **with description when exact matches couldn't be found.**"
